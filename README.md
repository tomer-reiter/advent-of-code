My solutions to https://adventofcode.com/.

I don't try to be competetive on the leaderboards, instead I aim for some middle ground between fast and readable. I solve the problem and then spend a short amount of time cleaning up the code.

To run the code, just use python "puzzle_n.py". Note that you'll need files of the form "input_puzzle_n.txt" and "sample_input_puzzle_n.txt".
